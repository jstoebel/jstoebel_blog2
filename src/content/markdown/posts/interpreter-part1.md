title: "Building an Interpreter, part 1"

I'm working my way through Ruslan Spivak's tutorial _Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter_
https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/

Here are my notes and reflections from part 1

# Part 1

Compiler takes source code and preprocesses it into a machine language.

An interpreter interprets source code without turning it into machine language first. 

Lexical analysis: read input of characters and convert into a stream of tokens.
Token: an object represetning type and value. Example: the token "3" is an integer with value of 3

## exercises

### multiple digits

The assumptions are changing where instead of having digit->plus->digit we have an arbitrary number of digits followed by a plus followed by an arbitrary number of digits. Let’s write a function that eats tokens keeping track of their values until we hit a non integer. Then return the resulting values parsed as an integer. 

```python
  def eat_integers(self):
      """
      eats integers tokens until a non integer is found. 
      Returns teh resulting integers
      """
      result = ''
      while True:
          # eat tokens until you hit a non integer. Assume its a plus!
          curr_token = self.current_token
          try:
              self.eat(INTEGER)
              result += str(curr_token.value)
          except InterpreterParseError as e:
              return int(''.join(result))

```

### spaces

Rather than have the interpreter process spaces, I am going to punt and remove them prior to processing. We can't allow spaces just anywhere however ('1 0 + 3' for example). For a space character to be legal both of its neighboors must be either a space or different token from one another. Here's how I'm doing it:

```python
@staticmethod
def strip_text(text):
    """
    strips valid empty space from expression
    text: expression string
    returns: expression with valid spaces removed
    """
    split_expr = text.split('+') # split expression on plus, getting list of two expressions.
    stripped = [ char.strip() for char in split_expr] # strip leading and trailing white space
    return '+'.join(stripped) # join expressions together with a plus in the middle
```

### Support addition or subtraction

I may have gone overboard on this one :) I wanted to generalize the concept of an operator which takes two numbers and, using a common interface returns the result. Further, I wanted to later be able to construct an AST of operator nodes and integer leaf nodes. All of these nodes respond to `value` which allows for computing an expression by calling `value` on the root and recursivly evaluating each node. Here's what I did.

First I extracted the `Token` class, to keep as my base class

```python
class Token(object):
    """
    an abstract class representing all tokens
    Inheriting classes must:
        - define a self.type in their __init__
        - implement a `value` property
    """
    def __str__(self):
        """String representation of the class instance.
        Examples:
            Token(INTEGER, 3)
            Token(PLUS '+')
        """
        return 'Token({type}, {value})'.format(
            type=self.type,
            value=repr(self.value)
        )

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.__str__()
```

Next I defined an abstract `OperatorToken` which represents any binary operator.

```python
class OperatorToken(Token):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        __slots__ = 'left_value', 'right_value'
        self.left_value = None
        self.right_value = None

    def __str__(self):
        """String representation of the class instance.
        Examples:
            Token(INTEGER, 3)
            Token(PLUS '+')
        """
        return 'Token({type}, {left}, {right})'.format(
            type=self.type,
            left=self.left_value,
            right=self.right_value
        )
```

A general binary operator has a `left_value` and a `right_value`. The child class will implement `value` which determines the result.

Next, we've got two operators, addition and subtraction. Really their only differences are 1) they need to know their `type` and 2) they both need to implement a property `value` which returns either the sum or difference of their two values.

```python
class AddToken(OperatorToken):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.type = 'PLUS'
        super().__init__()

    @property
    def value(self):
        """
        returns the sum of left_value and right_value
        """
        return self.left_value.value + self.right_value.value

class SubtractToken(OperatorToken):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.type = 'MINUS'
        super().__init__()

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self.left_value.value - self.right_value.value
```

Next, how to represent numbers? Really there's two different concepts to deal with. The first is an integer token, which is a single digit.

```py
class IntToken(Token):
    """
    represents a single numeric character. Example '3'
    """
    def __init__(self, value: str) -> None:
        self.value = value
        self.type = INTEGER
```

Next is the concept of an entire number, which is composed of one or many digits. Let's think of that as an object which wraps a list of `IntTokens`

```py
class IntWrapper(Token):
    """
    a list of IntTokens that represent an integer.
    """
    def __init__(self, tokens: List[IntToken] ) -> None:
        self.tokens = tokens
        self.type = INT_WRAPPER

    @property
    def value(self) -> int:
        number_strings = [int_token.value for int_token in self.tokens]
        return int(''.join(number_strings))
```

And finally, we have the `EOF` token. Not much to say there.

```py
class EOFToken(Token):
    def __init__(self):
        self.type = EOF
        self.value = None
```

The update to `expr` in Interpreter looks like this

```py
def expr(self):
    # set current token to the first token taken from the input
    self.current_token = self.get_next_token()

    left = self.eat_integers()

    # we expect the current token to be a '+' or '-' token
    operator = self.current_token
    self.eat(token.PLUS, token.MINUS)

    # we expect the current token to be a single-digit integer
    right = self.eat_integers()

    operator.left_value = left
    operator.right_value = right
    # after the above call the self.current_token is set to
    # EOF token
    return operator.value
```

Finally, I need to update my `strip_text` method to allow subtraction

```py
def strip_text(self, text):
    """
    strips valid empty space from expression
    text: expression string
    returns: expression with valid spaces removed
    """

    try:
        operator = re.search(r'[\+-]', text).group(0) # find the operator, either a + or -
    except(AttributeError):
        raise self.error('expression does not contain an operator') # this error means neither operator was found. Throw our custom exception

    split_expr = text.split(operator)
    stripped = [ char.strip() for char in split_expr]
    return operator.join(stripped)
```

This architecture opens the door for constructing a more complex abstract syntax tree, with any number of binary operators.
