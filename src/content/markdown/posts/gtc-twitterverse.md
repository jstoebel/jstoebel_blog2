The panelists talk about the thermodynamics of the Twitterverse. This includes getting sucked into Twitter vortexes, dynamics of human emotion, creating safe spaces for emotionally charged conversations, radical inclusion, overidentification, digital activism, tribal dynamics, having the right to rage, changing frequencies of people, call-out culture, and that ultimately: everyone is human.
